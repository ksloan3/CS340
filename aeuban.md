I am Austin Eubank, a sophomore CS major with cybersecurity minor at UTK. I'm a member of the 
UTK Esports club and the representative for Smash Melee. I like video games and have always had 
an affinity for coding. I'm looking forward to learning how to better use github and work as a team on 
programming projects. For my project I'd like to make a game of some sort, particularly something with 
a turn-based combat system.
