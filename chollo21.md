I am Jaden Hollowell and I am in computer engineering. I took this class to ensure that
I still worked on software in my studies, and I am excited to build something that I can
be proud of and show to others. I'm not sure what I want to work on for the project. I 
have been leaning towards game design, but I am really open.
