Hi, I'm Julien Devol, a 21 year old junior Computer Science student. I entered college not truly knowing what I wanted to pursue at the time (beginning as an English major, then Math) until I met a wonderful professor at Pellissippi State, Cindy Arnold, who inspired me to make the switch to Computer Science. In my freetime I make music, digital art, write stories, and take part in game jams.
