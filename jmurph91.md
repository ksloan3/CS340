I am Jackson Murphy, a junior Computer Science student intrested in developing quality software with real world applications. 
I am particularly interested in Sports Analytics and Machine Learning, and I am excited to collaborate on projects that leverage these technologies to solve complex problems. 
My goal is to strengthen my teamwork and communication skills while building a atrong portfolio project. 
One specific concept I am exploring is an ML driven email parser that learns user interaction patterns to intelligently automate mail sorting.
