I am Koushik Sanjay Saravana Kumar, and I am majoring in Computer
Science. I am a sophomore at UTK, and I have been working
as an Undergraduate Research Assistant since last summer. 
I am interested in machine learning, building and training classification 
models, and working with data. So, I would like my project to be dealing 
with databases and data analytics.
