I am Mithun Titus Maria Ruban Raj, and I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I am excited to learn more about the software development processes while also
collaborating with other students on an interesting yet useful project. I am interested in working on data analysis and optimizing it through AI models by training them
on deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. I am also interested in working on something related to the automotive industry. I hope to learn and grow more through
this course.
