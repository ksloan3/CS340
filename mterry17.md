I am Magnus Terry and I am a EECS student who wants to specialize in Cyber Security. In my free time I am a rock climber and work at a local rock climbing gym as a route setter. I am taking this class as an excuse to work on a big group project to hopefully flesh out my resume and I would ideally want to program a video game engine for my project.
